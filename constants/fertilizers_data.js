  "description" : "Urea (46% N). This is the most concentrated solid nitrogen fertiliser and it is marketed in the prilled form. It is sometimes used for aerial top-dressing. In the soil, urea changes to ammonium carbonate which may temporarily cause a harmful local high pH.",

  "benifits" : "The main function of Urea fertilizer is to provide the plants with nitrogen to promote green leafy growth and make the plants look lush. Urea also aids the photosynthesis process of plants. Since urea fertilizer can provide only nitrogen and not phosphorus or potassium, it's primarily used for bloom growth.",

  "npkValues" : "The NPK grade of a solid urea fertilizer is 46-0-0. Another fertilizer containing high concentration of urea is Urea Ammonium Nitrate (UAN). UAN is a liquid fertilizer containing between 28 and 32% nitrogen. 50% of the nitrogen is urea, 25% ammonium nitrogen and 25% nitrate nitrogen.",

  "description" : "Di-ammonium Phosphate popularly known as DAP is a preferred fertilizer in India because it contains both Nitrogen and Phosphorus which are primary macro-nutrients and part of 18 essential plant nutrients.",

  "benifits" : "Increase in crop yield. DAP fertilizers are essential for those areas that lack proper nutrients and minerals in the soil.",

  "npkValues" : "Therefore, the standard nutrient grade of this fertilizer is 18-46-0. This means, it has nitrogen and phosphorous in the ratio of 18:46, but it has no potassium.",

  "benifits" : "It contains the highest nutrient content 63%, amongst all NPK complex fertilisers. Gromor 14-35-14 is suitable for a variety of crops like Paddy, Groundnut, Cotton, Sunflower, Wheat, Potato, Vegetables, etc.",

  "npkValues" : "Studies have found that the ideal NPK fertilizer ratio of those nutrients for flowering plants is 3-1-2. (That's 3% Nitrogen, 1% phosphorus & 2% potassium.) So look for that ratio on the label of packaged fertilizers; anything close to a 3-1-2, a 6-2-4 or a 9-3-6 should be ideal.",
